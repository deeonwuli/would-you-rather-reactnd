# Would-you-rather reactnd project

Would you rather project is a game that allows users to select a player, answer questions asked by other users and ask questions that can be answered. The project emphasizes using React and Redux to build the application and provides an API server and client library that will be used to persist information as you interact with the application.

You can login and logout as any of the predefined users and play the game.
